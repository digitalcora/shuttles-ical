## ðŸ“… Subscribe

To get these events in your own calendar, copy this iCal URL and add it to your
calendar app:

### `<%= @canonical_origin %>/alerts.ics`

The process for doing this varies, but in the end you're looking for a box you
can paste a URL into (_not_ something that asks you to upload a file). Look for
words like "feed", "sync", or "subscribe". If stuck, try a web search for your
calendar app name plus _"ical feed"_.

<blockquote>
<details>
<summary><b>Developer options</b></summary>
To easily inspect the raw feed in your browser, replace <code>.ics</code> with
<code>.txt</code> in the URL.
</details>
</blockquote>


## âš  Limitations

* The calendar only shows disruptions on rapid transit lines (Blue, Green,
  Orange, Red). To get alerts about Commuter Rail, bus, or ferry disruptions,
  try [**T-Alerts**](https://alerts.mbta.com/).

* The calendar does not show _all_ disruptions on rapid transit. The goal is to
  surface disruptions that can substantially impact a ride, and are planned in
  advance (and thus useful to display on a calendar). Shuttle buses and station
  closures are typical examples.

* The calendar does not show the exact time(s) a disruption is scheduled to
  start and end; all disruptions are shown as "all-day" events. This creates a
  more readable calendar view (and avoids cluttering your personal calendar, if
  you subscribe to the feed). Check event descriptions for timing details.

* The calendar does not show past disruptions. This is a limitation of the MBTA
  alerts API, and working around it would not be worth the added complexity.

## ðŸ’» About the author

I'm [Cora], a software engineer on the MBTA's [Customer Technology][ctd] team.
I created this project using the agency's [public data and APIs][devs], partly
as an exercise in learning [Crystal], and partly as a tiny public service that
fills a niche the MBTA itself does not.
